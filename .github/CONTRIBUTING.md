## Issues

I want to hear about any issues you encounter while using age.

Particularly appreciated are well researched, complete [issues](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/issues/new/choose) with lots of context, **focusing on the intended outcome and/or use case**. Issues don't have to be just about bugs: if something was hard to figure out or unexpected, please file a **[UX report](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/discussions/new?category=UX-reports)**! ✨

Not all issue reports might lead to a change, so please don't be offended if yours doesn't, but they are precious datapoints to understand how age could work better in aggregate.

## Pull requests

age is a little unusual in how it is maintained. I like to keep the code style consistent and complexity to a minimum, and going through many iterations of code review is a significant toil on both contributors and maintainers. age is also small enough that such a time investment is unlikely to pay off over ongoing contributions.

Therefore, **be prepared for your change to get reimplemented rather than merged**, and please don't be offended if that happens. PRs are still appreciated as a way to clarify the intended behavior, but are not at all required: prefer focusing on providing detailed context in an issue report instead.

<!-- ## Feature requests

age is small, simple, and config-free by design. A lot of effort is put into resisting scope creep and enabling use cases by integrating and interoperating well with other projects rather than by adding features.

In particular, I'm unlikely to merge into the main repo anything I don't use myself, as I would not be the best person to maintain it. However, I'm always happy to discuss, learn about, and link to any age-related project! -->

## Other ways to contribute

age itself is not community maintained, but its ecosystem very much is, and that's where a lot of the strength of age is! Here are some ideas for ways to contribute to age and its ecosystem, besides contributing to this repository.

* **Write an article about how to use age for a certain community or use case.** The number one reason people don't use age is because they haven't heard about it and existsing tutorials present more complex alternatives.
* Integrate age into existing projects that might use it, for example replacing legacy alternatives.
* Build and maintain an [age plugin](https://c2sp.org/age-plugin) for a KMS or platform.
* Watch the [discussions](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/discussions) and help other users.
* Provide bindings in a langauge or framework that doesn't support age well.
* Package age for an ecosystem that doesn't have packages yet.
