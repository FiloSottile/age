age is meant to be a simple, secure and modern encryption tool with small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability. The spec is at [age-encryption.org/v1](https://age-encryption.org/v1).

This implementation is in progress, and things will keep moving around, so it's not yet a good time to contribute, and it's definitely not a good time to rely on it.

To discuss the spec or other age related topics, please email the mailing list at age-dev@googlegroups.com. Subscribe at [groups.google.com/d/forum/age-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/age-dev) or by emailing age-dev+subscribe@googlegroups.com.

Development is sometimes livestreamed at [twitch.tv/filosottile](https://www.twitch.tv/filosottile).
