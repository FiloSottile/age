age is meant to be a simple, secure and modern encryption tool with small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability. The spec is at [age-tool.com](https://age-tool.com).

This implementation is in progress, and things will keep moving around all week, so it's not yet a good time to contribute, and it's definitely not a good time to rely on it.
